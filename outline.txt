requirements
============
pass list of files to script
fail with no args
process single file at a time
what type of files are we processing (videos, other) -- choose once
display total number of files (args) to process
allow interruption of processing to finish what we've done so far
display file name and extension, then:
    prompt for author(s) tag
    display file name (without extension or tag) and prompt for changes
    sanitize filename
    prompt for where it's going (live/3d/animated)
    prompt for finalize confirmation
if there were any errors, prompt to retry the error files (indefinitely)


UX/UI
=====

===================
Processing XX files
===================

Job 1/XX
Filename: some_file_name.mp4

Author tag (optional): author
New name (optional): new name

Proposed filename: [author]_new_name.mp4
Accept name [Y/n]?:

Categories:
0: Live
1: 3D
2: Animated

Category #: 0

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Job 2/XX
Filename: some_other_file_name.mp4

...

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Processed: XX
Dropped: 0

===============
Moving XX files
===============

[author]_file_0.mp4: moved
[author]_file_1.mp4: moved
[author]_file_2.mp4: destination already exists
[author]_file_3.mp4: error
    File not found (or whatever)
[author]_file_4.mp4: file in use

Moved: 2/4
Duplicates: 1
Files in use: 1
Other errors: 1

<!> There were some errors during processing, attempting to resolve them now...

Some files already exist at their destination.
Delete the source files (d), overwrite destination (o), or ignore (i)?
[D/o/i]: 

Some files appeared to be in use when attempting to move them:

original_file_name.mp4 -> [author]_file_4.mp4

Retry move? [Y/n]: 

[author]_file_4.mp4: moved

The following files experienced other errors during their move:

some_file_name.mp4 -> [author]_file_3.mp4
>>> <Exception message here>


pseudo code
===========
if no args are present, exit with error
load env variables; exit with error if any are missing
choose what type of files we're handling (video/other), make relevant factory

() convert args into MoveObjects:
create empty obj list
get number of arguments to be processed (total jobs)
create iteration counter at 0
for arg in args
    try:
        report job number out of total jobs
        create new MoveObject with arg using MoveObjectFactory
        validate file (arg 1): exists, is a file
        print filename + extension
        prompt for author tag
        prompt for new file name
        sanitize the rest of the filename
        prompt for confirmation of finalization
        create new path object with new file name
        add obj to processing list
    except ValueError
        continue
    except KeyboardInterrupt
        break
    else
        increment iteration counter
return obj list


() attempt to move objects:



process move attempt results:





possible errors: duplicate, permission error (file open)
for obj in processing list copy
    try:
        obj.move()
    except OSError (permissions)
        add to error list
    .
